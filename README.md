py-ctrlk
========

This is the server side of the [CtrlK](https://github.com/SkidanovAlex/CtrlK) plugin.

To install it, just call

  ```bash
  pip install [--user] ctrlk
  ```

This repo was converted from level-db pip package, so the file structure and tests are from leveldb. All the CtrlK related stuff is in the ctrlk folder.
